# Darts
A simple console application written in C# [First project, so excuse any rookie mistakes :3]

Cool stuff about it:
  - Unlimited Players (Want to play alone? With three friends? Your entire 5000 head company? sure no problem (but it might take a while...))
  - Cool colors (they actually aren't that cool)
  - Your results will be saved as a csv file stating the date, the winner, gamemode (currently only 301 and 501) and every player's name and score
  - It's only in german. I mean... how cool is that... (english copy can be made on request)
  
Not so cool stuff:
  - As it is my first project, it's probably garbage, but hey... [it's working](https://youtu.be/YPN0qhSyWy8) :)
